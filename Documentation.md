# Bayesian ALS Code
In this repository you find the code of the algorithm developed in the paper "Alternating Linear Scheme in a Bayesian Framework for low-rank tensor approximation". The algorithm use objects of the classes "Tensor", "Core" (subclass of Tensor), "probCore" (subclass of Core), "MPT" and probMPT (subclass of MPT) as discribed below. 

The algorithm can be tested with the toy examples in the "Numerical_Experiments" folder.
